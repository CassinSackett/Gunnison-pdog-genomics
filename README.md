DNA sequence files useful for conducting genome-wide analyses of Cynomys gunnisoni

1. The reference genome, constructed via hybrid assembly of 20x PacBio and 50X Illumina reads, can be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/88048?genome_assembly_id=820511 and the paper describing the methods for genome assembly is here: https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/12/5/618/5819143

2. Four sets of baits were designed for sequence-capture studies using different numbers of loci: 20,000 and 60,000 100bp baits for museum/degraded DNA, and 20,000 and 60,000 120bp baits for modern DNA.
